# The kb session start fits in the 10,000 characters a hook keeps

Status: accepted (Mark, 2026-10-26, kb record [1189]); supersedes the child's slim output in
[0001](0001-pipeline-mother-and-child-sessions.md)

Claude Code keeps a hook's output in context only up to 10,000 characters. Past that the model
gets a file path and the first 2,000 characters. The kb SessionStart hook printed the whole
index and the standup, 29,954 characters on kaertech-odoo-16 on 2026-10-26 (pinned 6,587,
recent 19,917, standup 3,211), so the standup and most pinned rules never reached the model.
The slim output of 0001 was meant for pipeline children, keyed on a `[child] ` title, but the
desktop app passes no `session_title` to the hook, so it never fired.

Mark chose what the start carries, the same for every session:

- **The pinned rules, one line each**, as `kb index` prints them (slug and a summary cut at 160
  characters). Their bodies (299 KB) cannot fit; `kb show` reads one.
- **The standup as one count line**: open tasks, loud, quiet. `kb today` prints the list; the
  user sees it in the kb band. Nothing is recorded as shown.
- **The recent records as a count**: `kb index` lists them.
- **Notices** (`kb add --once`) **as a count**: the model tells the user and hands them
  `kb notices show` to run in their own terminal. The notices close when it prints them, and
  their text never enters the model's context. Shown only in the kb band, Mark would miss them.
  **Superseded by kb record [1227]** (Mark, 2026-10-26): notices live only in the kb pane, with
  a dismiss button and a count in the band; the session start prints no notices line and never
  calls `kb notices`, and `kb notices show` no longer closes them.
- **No child mode**: one output fits every session.

The sessions closed without a summary keep their one line: an instruction to the model, not
part of the task list.

The hook holds the whole output under 9,500 characters, counted as Claude Code counts them
(UTF-16 code units). Past that, the last pinned rules give way first, to a line naming
`kb index`; if that is not enough, the output is cut at a line with a line saying so. What the
model must act on prints first, so it is kept longest. Measured with the real kb on
2026-10-26: 7,240 characters, with room for about 12 more pinned rules before any give way.

## Considered options

- **Pinned rules cut to 100 characters, or slug only.** Rejected: the summary is the rule, and
  the cut end is where the exception lives. Slug only means a `kb show` per rule.
- **The most urgent standup tasks that fit, or the loud ones only.** Rejected for a count: 20
  of 23 tasks were loud, so a loud-only list saved little, and the user has the list in the kb
  band.
- **The 10 newest recent records.** Rejected: `kb index` on demand.

## Consequences

- `kb today --record-shown` no longer runs at the session start, so a `--once` task is closed
  by `kb notices show` (kb PR okolovmark/kb#7). A kb from before `kb notices` prints no
  count: its notices wait until kb is upgraded. **Superseded by kb record [1227]**: a notice
  closes by `kb notices dismiss`, the kb pane's dismiss button.
- A model that needs the standup list or a recent record runs `kb today` or `kb index`.
